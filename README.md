## Quick Setup: Local Development Environment
To quickly set up a local development environment that includes the necessary tools (style50, check50, and submit50), simply open a terminal in your working directory and run the command `pipenv install check50 submit50 style50`. This will create a virtual environment that you can access by running `pipenv shell`. Once you are inside the virtual environment, you can use the necessary *50 commands. If you don't have pipenv installed, you can install it by running `pip3 install pipenv`.

For more information on using pipenv, please see the [Pipenv documentation](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Important Note: Academic Honesty Policy
Please do not submit my solutions as your own work.

It is important to note that CS50 staff regularly review submissions for this course. Students found to be in violation of the academic honesty policy will be removed from the course and will not be eligible for a certificate.
